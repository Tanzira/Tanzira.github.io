## Bio
I am a sixth-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at The University of Texas at San Antonio, with an expected graduation date in May 2024. My research primarily revolves around exploratory data analysis and statistical validation of biological data, under the supervision of [Dr. Jianhua Ruan](https://sciences.utsa.edu/faculty/profiles/ruan-jianhua.html). I have published two journal papers and submitted two more this year. Additionally, several projects are in progress, with imminent plans for publication.

My expertise lies in leveraging machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling and conducting rigorous statistical analyses. Proficient in the Python programming language, I am adept at utilizing common statistical and machine learning libraries, including Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scipy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I possess hands-on experience in building and training machine learning models, implementing feature engineering strategies for large-scale datasets, and conducting both supervised and unsupervised model training.

Moreover, I am well-versed in project management using Git, ensuring efficient collaboration and version control. My comprehensive skill set and extensive experience position me as a versatile and knowledgeable researcher in the field of data science.

**Research Interests:** Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Computational Biology
